# GT NEI Ore Plugin
This is a fork of [GWYOG's GTNEIOrePlugin](https://github.com/GWYOG/GTNEIOrePlugin) for use outside of GTNH and for easier accessibility (Baidu download is unusable)

The original project is kept at the `official` branch. If further maintenance are done, it will be on the `main` branch

The original README is below.
